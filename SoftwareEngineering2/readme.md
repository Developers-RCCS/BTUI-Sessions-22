# Software Engineering

* In this session, we look at how a real-life software system can be developed in stages, based on
the Software Architectures we discussed in the previous session. The demo will be aimed at
absolute beginners, using tools such as MySQL and Python. Finally, we will take to automating some of your 'boring' tasks using software, so you no longer have to do them
every day.
